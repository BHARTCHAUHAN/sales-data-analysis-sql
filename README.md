# sales-data-analysis-sql
SQL-based sales data analysis project with MySQL queries for trends, profits, and top categories.


# Sales Data Analysis 
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is part of my internship Task 4, where I worked with a retail sales dataset to find useful business insights using SQL.  
The main goal was to explore the data, perform aggregations, and answer important questions like:
- Which categories generate the most sales?
- Which products give the highest profit?
- What are the top-selling items by quantity?

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Details
The dataset contains sales records with the following columns:
- **Order ID** â€“ Unique ID for each order
- **Amount** â€“ Total sales amount
- **Profit** â€“ Profit made from the sale
- **Quantity** â€“ Units sold
- **Category** â€“ Main product category
- **Sub-Category** â€“ Specific product type

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **MySQL Workbench** â€“ For writing and executing queries  
- **MySQL Server** â€“ To store and manage the dataset

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Performed
Hereâ€™s what I analysed in this project:
1. **Total sales by category** â€“ To see which category earns the most.
2. **Total profit by category** â€“ To understand which category is more profitable.
3. **Top 5 sub-categories by sales** â€“ The best-selling products by revenue.
4. **Top 5 sub-categories by profit** â€“ The products that give the highest profit.
5. **Top 5 sub-categories by quantity sold** â€“ Products that are sold the most in terms of units.

## ðŸ–¼ Output
I have added screenshots of the query results in the `outputs/` folder so that the results are easy to understand without running the queries again.

## ðŸ“œ How to Use

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-link>
